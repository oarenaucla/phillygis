# **Group Name: Logan Triangle: Health, History, and Home in Philadelphia**
### **Group Members: Olivia Arena, Lindsey Morris, Deja McCauley, Cassie Truong**

#### Research Question
In terms of public health, affordable housing, amenities, public transit access to open space, and public risk, what community needs emerge as a priority for North Philadelphia’s Logan neighborhood when using indicators (race, unemployment, food accessibility, open space access, crime, and housing) to compare the area to the city as a whole?

#### Why this Matters
Within the Logan neighborhood of Philadelphia, there is an area called Logan Triangle, which encompasses 48 vacant acres - making it one of the city’s largest sites of contiguous unused land. Since the early 20th century, Logan Triangle’s history has been fraught. Although it was once home to over 5,000 Philadelphians, the instability of the land and other environmental hazards (both human-caused) led to the demolition of homes and displacement of residents. The 2023 American Planning Association’s Student Design Competition, uses Logan Triangle as a case study. Our team is tasked with creating a long-term plan for the area that focuses on public health, open space and nature, affordable housing, inclusive design and amenities, and the neighborhood’s history. There is an opportunity and need to redress the physical, environmental, and emotional harms that have occurred in Logan Triangle and the intent of the project is to envision a site that best serves the surrounding and future community of Logan Triangle. In this course, we plan to use spatial data and GIS to better understand existing conditions and community needs.

#### Spatial Scope
The subject area will encompass the Logan Neighborhood of Philadelphia, as defined by the Logan Comprehensive Neighborhood Plan. The Neighborhood is bound by Olney Avenue on the North, E. Wister Street and Stenton Avenue on the West, N. 6th Street on the East, and W. Wingohocking Street on the South. The Logan Community Development Corporation has been working with residents since 2008 to identify and address community issues, such as disparities in employment, public health, access to high-quality housing, and open green space in the neighborhood. The Logan Triangle lies in the center of the neighborhood. This 48-acre block of land targeted for redevelopment was the site of a subsidence crisis where all residential homes were eventually demolished and its residents displaced. Today it offers the opportunity to provide Logan residents with much needed support services and infrastructure. As our project seeks to understand the needs and priorities of Logan as defined by its residents, we will explore the area used in the Comprehensive Neighborhood Plan. (see map below)

####  Data Sources
Our team will use Social Explorer and Philadelphia Open Data to analyze the neighborhood around the Logan Neighborhood and the greater Philadelphia area. Social Explorer will provide census data needed to better understand the community in Logan. Data downloaded from Social Explorer will include the (ACS 5-Year Estimates 2017-2021). The majority of our data will come from Philadelphia Open Data, which provides datasets on Census Tracts, Affordable Housing Production from DHCD, Complaints against Police, SEPTA Locations API, Parks and Recreation. We anticipate that our data sources will expand as our research evolves.

####  Conclusion & Expectations 
In order to assess the needs of the Logan Neighborhood residents, our team will create and analyze a data profile around housing, open space, food accessibility, racial backgrounds and unemployment, and public risk. We will compare how these indicators differ between the larger Philadelphia area and the smaller Logan Neighborhood. Our goal is to spatially and graphically depict Logan’s current needs through various charts, plots, graphs and maps. These data visualizations will provide the evidence for design and policy recommendations that may better serve the Logan Neighborhood. 

Through our research, we expect to gain insights on the type of community needs present for North Philadelphia’s Logan neighborhood residents. Specifically, we would like to gain a quantitative understanding of the access that Logan residents have to public health services, affordable housing, amenities, and open space. Furthermore, we would like to compare the access that Logan residents have in comparison to the city as a whole. In the future, there will also be opportunities to analyze how variables, such as race, income, and access to public transit service intersect with Philadelphia resident’s access to services and amenities. Ultimately, we hope to develop a comprehensive spatial data analysis and produce powerful visuals that demonstrate the community needs of Logan, Philadelphia to inform the recommendations proposed for Logan Triangle.
